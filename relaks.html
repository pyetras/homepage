Some, such as SQL hide away the complexity by providing a fixed set of highly optimized and yet expressive high-level operations such as SELECT, JOIN etc. Others, such as my personal favourite, Prolog, allow achieving similar results while ganting unlimited flexibility.</p>
<p>The design of Prolog is simple and beautiful. It basically does just two things, and it does them really well: allowing you to specify a search tree for your problem and then traversing that tree.</p>
<p>The devil is in the details though: Prolog's logic based rules are pure and merciless. One overlooked condition, and the program would be stuck forever, generating and mindlessly following an infinite number of branches in the tree, while the solution might lie just in the <em>other</em> child of the starting node.</p>
<p>In my opinion the language of the future does not <em>traverse</em> the tree specified by the programmer, whether it's an Abstract Syntax Tree that is translated literally to a sequence of operations, or a tree of theorems and conclusions explored by Prolog. Instead it <em>searches</em> through it.</p>
<p>Consider the following statement:</p>
<pre><code>val k = choose between 1 and 5
select k where k == 2</code></pre>
<p>Looks simple enough, right? With a slight syntax alterations Prolog could do it. SQL could do it, if <code>choose</code> was a function that generates a table of numbers. Even Pyhton in Python, a code where <code>choose</code> is replaced by <code>range</code> would look similar enough. How about</p>
<pre><code>val k = choose between 1.0 and 5.0
select k where k == 2.0</code></pre>
<p>In theory it should be unsolvable by Prolog in the straightforward, left to right tree traversal - there is an infinitely many numbers between 1.0 and 2.0 (even though an implementation of this search based on computer's representation of floating numbers would eventually finish). How about</p>
<pre><code>optimize (knnExperiment) by errorRate asc limit 10</code></pre>
<p>What I would like this expression to do is to run a K Nearest Neighbors algorithm ten times while trying to find the minimum <code>errorRate</code> with respect to its parameters.</p>

<p>An experimental implementation of a language of the future with a numerical optimizer as a DSL for Scala is available at <a href="//github.com/pyetras/relaks">Github</a>. This was part of my <a href="/relaks.pdf">Master's Thesis</a>.</p></article></div></div><!--inject:vendor:js--><!--endinject--><!--inject:js--><!--endinject--></body></html>
